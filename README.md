## Problem Statement

In many residential neighborhoods, managing communal funds can be fraught with challenges, including lack of transparency, accountability, and susceptibility to corruption. Residents often find it difficult to trust the management of communal finances, leading to disputes and a lack of engagement in community affairs. The absence of a transparent and secure system can result in missed payments, inefficient fund allocation, and social discord among residents.

## Solution

The Neighborhood Community Fund is a decentralized smart contract designed to facilitate community fund management within residential neighborhoods. It allows unit owners to contribute to communal funds while enabling whitelisted committees to request payments for various community services. The contract ensures transparency, accountability, and secure management of funds.

### Key Features

#### Transparency and Auditability

The fund functions like a communal bank account, where every transaction—whether contributions or withdrawals—is recorded on the blockchain. This open ledger allows residents to audit the fund, ensuring transparency in how community resources are allocated and used.

#### Prevention of Misconduct

The transparent nature of the fund acts as a deterrent against corruption, bribery, and money laundering. With all transactions publicly accessible, individuals are less likely to engage in dishonest practices, fostering a culture of integrity and ethical behavior.

#### Payment Compliance and Social Responsibility

Residents can easily see which units have made their payments and which have not, promoting accountability and social pressure to fulfill obligations. This visibility encourages timely contributions and enhances community engagement.

#### Interactive Site Plan UI

An interactive SVG site plan visually represents the payment status of each unit, making it easy for residents to identify their financial responsibilities. This engaging interface not only simplifies understanding but also enhances communication within the community.

#### Detailed Transaction History

Residents can preview each unit's transaction history, offering insights into past contributions and withdrawals. This immutable record, stored on the blockchain, reinforces the fund's transparency and allows individuals to track their financial participation.
